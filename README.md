## About
Welcome! I am PhD student conducting research in eye movement biometrics. My research interest involves studying the behavior of eye movement in mixed reality devices. I am proficient in research study design, data analysis, project management, and identifying new avenues to expand the field of eye tracking research.
Most of my repositories are currently private; they become publicly available as supplementary material for publications. 

**I am always interested in collaboration.** 
## Most Recent Projects
### Eye Movement Data Collection
Using Unity, I design data collection protocols that elicit and collect a variety of eye movement in virtual/augmented reality devices. APIs provided by the manufacturers of such devices are not designed for research applications; I re-engineer these APIs to meet our needs. Compatible platforms include the Microsoft HoloLens 2, PupilLabs, FOVE, and SensoMotoric Instruments. 
### Eye Movement Data Quality Assessment
Using R, MATLAB, and Python, I characterize eye movement data based on metrics like accuracy, precision, linearity, and crosstalk. My data quality assessment is compatible with both 2D and 3D eye movement data.
I assess and compare the quality of data collected across a variety of platforms. Through my analysis, I discover quirks about an eye tracker that are otherwise not documented.
### Deep Learning Approach to Biometric Authentication
Python, PyTorch. See our [publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9304859) for an in-depth explanation.
